# myOwnArchInstall
My own archinstall script, because I've been installing it 5 time this week and I'm tired of installing it manually.

-- WORK IN PROGRESS --<br>
After putting everything in place, execute this :
```sh
sudo pacman -S eza zoxide $(pacman -Sgq nerd-fonts) ruby npm
gem install solargraph --user
npm install -g pyright```
